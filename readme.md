Samotraces.js
-------------

Samotraces.js is a JavaScript version of the Samotraces 
project (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/samotraces/).
Samotraces.js provides a set of tools to collect, 
visualise and manage traces.

### Trace management

Samotraces.js offers differents solutions to manage traces.
A first, lightweight solution consists in creating and 
managing the trace solely on the client side. This solution 
is useful for testing Samotraces and doesn't require any 
installation of trace management software. You can try it 
now on your web-browser. However, the created trace will not
be stored.

The second main solution currently implemented consists in 
storing traces in a ktbs (see TODO).
This solution allow to benefit from all the services offered
by the ktbs.
This solution requires to install a ktbs software.

Further solutions will be offered to connect to other trace 
management systems.

### Trace collection

### Trace visualisation

Samotraces.js provides trace visualisation widgets. Each 
widget can be using other visualisation frameworks or tools.

Currently, the main visualisation widget uses the d3.js 
framework. Other visualisation widgets are coming soon...
