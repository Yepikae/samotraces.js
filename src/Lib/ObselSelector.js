 * @description
 * The {@link Samotraces.Lib.ObselSelector|ObselSelector} object
 * is a Javascript object that stores the currently selected obsel.
 * This Object stores an obsel that is selected and informs 
 * widgets or other objects (via the 
 * {@link Samotraces.Lib.ObselSelector#event:obselSelected|obselSelected}
 * and the 
 * {@link Samotraces.Lib.ObselSelector#event:obselUnselected|obselUnselected}
 * events) when the selected object changes
 * or if the obsel has been unselected. When first instanciated,
 * no obsel is selected.
 *
 * In order to select an obsel, the 
 * {@link Samotraces.Lib.ObselSelector#select|ObselSelector#select()} 
 * method has to be called.
 * Similarly, in order to unselect an obsel, the 
 * {@link Samotraces.Lib.ObselSelector#unselect|ObselSelector#unselect()} 
 * method has to be called.
 * 
 * Note: selecting a new obsel is equivalent to unselecting 
 * the current obsel and selecting the new obsel, except
 * that the widget listening to the 
 * {@link Samotraces.Lib.ObselSelector} events will only 
 * receive a
 * {@link Samotraces.Lib.ObselSelector#event:obselSelected|obselSelected}, 
 * and no 
 * {@link Samotraces.Lib.ObselSelector#event:obselUnselected|obselUnselected}
 * event.
