<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This tutorial is divided in three parts.
The first part explains the basic concepts used in Samotraces.js
and will guide you to create a basic trace visualisation.
In the second part, you will learn how to instanciate different
widgets that can interact with each other, for instance to 
visualise the details of an obsel that is displayed on the
trace visualisation.
In the third part, you will learn how to personalise the visualisation
widget, allowing you to build an application that displays music traces.

By the end of the tutorial, you should have a decent grasp of
Samotraces.js and be able to use the framework by yourself, with
the support, of course, of the documentation.
